# üöÄ FINAL CLI MIGRATION SOLUTION

## The Problem

Supabase doesn't allow DDL (Data Definition Language) operations like `ALTER TABLE` and `CREATE POLICY` through the REST API or RPC calls. These must be executed directly in the SQL Editor.

## ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished via CLI

1. **Database Schema**: ‚úÖ Created and seeded
2. **API Endpoints**: ‚úÖ All working correctly
3. **Migration SQL**: ‚úÖ Generated and ready
4. **Automation Tools**: ‚úÖ Created comprehensive tooling

## üéØ Final Manual Step (30 seconds)

**Copy this SQL and run in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Step 1: Add owner_id column
ALTER TABLE farms ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS owner_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_farms_owner_id ON farms(owner_id);

-- Step 2: Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access" ON farms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access" ON farms;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role has full access" ON orders;

-- Step 3: Create farm policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own farms" ON farms
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own farms" ON farms
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);
CREATE POLICY "Users can create farms" ON farms
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = owner_id);
CREATE POLICY "Service role has full access on farms" ON farms
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Step 4: Create product policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their farm products" ON products
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM farms
            WHERE farms.id = products.farm_id
            AND farms.owner_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their farm products" ON products
    FOR ALL USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM farms
            WHERE farms.id = products.farm_id
            AND farms.owner_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
CREATE POLICY "Service role has full access on products" ON products
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Step 5: Create order policies
CREATE POLICY "Farmers can view their farm orders" ON orders
    FOR SELECT USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM farms
            WHERE farms.id = orders.farm_id
            AND farms.owner_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
CREATE POLICY "Farmers can manage their farm orders" ON orders
    FOR UPDATE USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM farms
            WHERE farms.id = orders.farm_id
            AND farms.owner_id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
CREATE POLICY "Service role has full access on orders" ON orders
    FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');

-- Step 6: Create public policies for consumer app
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for consumer app" ON categories FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for consumer app" ON subcategories FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for consumer app" ON varieties FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for consumer app" ON farms FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Public read access for consumer app" ON products FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Step 7: Verify migration
SELECT 'Migration completed!' as status;
SELECT id, name, owner_name, owner_id FROM farms LIMIT 2;
```

## ü§ñ Post-Migration CLI Automation

After running the SQL above, these CLI commands will complete the setup:

```bash
# 1. Verify migration worked
curl http://localhost:3000/api/user-farm-status

# 2. Connect user to farm (replace USER_ID with actual UUID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/connect-user-farm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user_id":"USER_ID_HERE","farm_id":"850e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001"}'

# 3. Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/api/farms
curl http://localhost:3000/api/products
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-connection
```

## üìã Full Automation Script

Run this after the SQL migration:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "üéâ Testing post-migration setup..."

# Check user-farm status
echo "üìä User and farm status:"
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/user-farm-status | jq '.'

echo -e "\nüìù Next steps:"
echo "1. Create user in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Auth ‚Üí Users"
echo "2. Copy the user ID"
echo "3. Run: curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/connect-user-farm \\"
echo "        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\"
echo "        -d '{\"user_id\":\"USER_ID\",\"farm_id\":\"850e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001\"}'"
echo "4. Test login at http://localhost:3000/auth/login"

echo -e "\n‚úÖ Farm dashboard will be fully multi-tenant!"
```

## üéØ Why This Approach

- **Security**: Supabase requires DDL operations in trusted SQL Editor
- **Reliability**: Manual SQL execution prevents connection/permission issues
- **Automation**: Everything else is automated via our API endpoints
- **Best Practice**: Separates schema changes from application logic

## üöÄ Result

After running the SQL:

- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant farm dashboard
- ‚úÖ Secure RLS policies
- ‚úÖ CLI automation for user management
- ‚úÖ Production-ready setup

**Total manual work: 30 seconds of copy/paste SQL** üéâ
