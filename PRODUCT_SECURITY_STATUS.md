# Product Security Status

## Current State ‚ö†Ô∏è

**SECURITY ISSUE**: Products can be edited by any authenticated user, not just the farm owner.

### What's Currently Implemented:
- ‚úÖ API endpoints for CRUD operations on products
- ‚úÖ Edit product form with proper validation
- ‚úÖ Basic farm_id filtering in PUT/DELETE (prevents cross-farm updates)
- ‚úÖ Products API supports farm_id query parameter
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No authentication check to verify user owns the farm

### Security Gaps:
1. **No user authentication** in API endpoints
2. **No farm ownership verification** - any user can edit any product
3. **Products list shows all products** instead of farm-specific products
4. **No session-based access control**

## Immediate Next Steps üîß

### 1. Implement Proper Authentication
```typescript
// Add to API endpoints
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
if (!user) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

### 2. Add Farm Ownership Verification
```typescript
// Verify user owns the farm that owns the product
const { data: farm } = await supabase
  .from('farms')
  .select('id')
  .eq('owner_id', user.id)
  .single()
```

### 3. Filter Products by Farm
```typescript
// In products page, fetch only user's farm products
const response = await fetch(`/api/products?farm_id=${userFarmId}`)
```

### 4. Add Row Level Security (RLS)
```sql
-- Enable RLS on products table
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policy for farm owners
CREATE POLICY "Farm owners can manage their products" ON products
  FOR ALL USING (
    farm_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM farms WHERE owner_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

## Current Temporary Safeguards üõ°Ô∏è

1. **Farm ID validation**: API checks that product belongs to existing farm
2. **Warning message**: UI shows development mode warning
3. **Admin client**: Using service role key prevents some client-side bypasses
4. **Audit trail**: All updates include timestamps

## Production Requirements üéØ

Before going live, implement:
- [ ] Complete authentication flow
- [ ] Farm ownership verification
- [ ] Row Level Security policies
- [ ] User session management
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## Testing Steps üß™

1. Create multiple test users with different farms
2. Verify users can only see/edit their own products
3. Test unauthorized access attempts
4. Verify RLS policies work correctly
5. Test session expiration and renewal
